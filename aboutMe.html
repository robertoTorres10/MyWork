    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class = "text">
      A recent graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago with a strong motivation and will in pursuing an education in web/app 
      development and programming field. Regularly working on myself to be better than the day before. Capable of being a vital team member 
      with years of experience working with various team members to accomplish any task. Always optimistic about learning and improving to 
      produce quality results. Having consistency and timely manner working habits are a strength of mine that has matured throughout the years. 
      Eager to learn and not afraid to learn more about what is to offer. 

      I'm passionate about many things. A list of it would require a whole page itself but in a nutshell. I enjoy traveling out of state visiting hiking trails and natural sceneries. My hobbies revolve around being active. I enjoy lifting weights early in the morning as well as playing
      tennis. This summer I have sparked an interest in golf. I enjoy taking photographs, specifically of nature's beauty! Down below are just a few of the snapshots
      I have taken the past year or two that I like and enjoy showing to friends and family. However, my favorite hobby of all is learning to code. There is much to learn
      and I want to grasp as much knowledge as I can in this field. Each day I set out to learn something new and put that skill to use.
