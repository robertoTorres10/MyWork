                    <h2>Hello!<br>My name is Roberto Torres.<br></h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a recent graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago, where 
                        I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science.
                        I am currently working on myself to kickstart my career in the field of 
                        programming, where I envision myself programming and creating material such as
                        web content and applications for everyday use. This page here 
                        showcases a bit of the work I have done to provide an insight into the skills 
                        and knowledge that I have learned. 
                        <br><br>
                        Personal interests of mine involve enjoying the great outdoors. I love traveling outside of home, outskirts 
                        of Chicago, and going out on roadtrips in search of the best hiking trails in the US. Hiking to the top
                        of a trail to view breath-taking scenary with my friends is a passion of mine. Im quite the athletic person
                        if I do say so myself as I enjoy playing tennis as well as lifting weights. A summer goal of mine is 
                        to improve my swing at the golf course as I have recently sparked in interest in golf.
                        <br><br>
                        Everyday I work on myself eager to learn more. In this field, I know there is plenty of material 
                        that I have yet to cover however, I'm excited to take on the challenge by learning as much as possible one step at a time.
                        I'm looking forward to seeing my skills grow and taking me far in the career I plan on having. I am 
                        thankful for your time and interest when browsing this page. I hope you enjoy my work!
